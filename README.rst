party
=====

party is **PA**\ ge-wise **R**\ ecognition of **T**\ ext-\ **y**. It is a
replacement for conventional text recognizers in ATR system using conventional
baseline+bounding polygon (where it eliminates the need for bounding polygons)
and bounding box line data models. 

Party consists of a Swin vision transformer encoder, baseline positional
embeddings, and a `tiny Llama decoder
<https://github.com/mittagessen/bytellama>`_ trained on octet tokenization.

Installation
------------

::

        $ pip install .


Fine Tuning
-----------

Party needs to be trained on datasets precompiled from PageXML or ALTO files
containing line-wise transcriptions and baseline information for each line. The
binary dataset format is **NOT** compatible with kraken but the process of
compilation is fairly similar:

::

        $ party compile -o dataset.arrow *.xml

It is recommended not to enable BiDi reordering as the pretrained language
model and the base model have been trained to recognize RTL text in logical
order.

It is recommended to disable BiDi reordering as the pretrained model has been
trained to recognize RTL text in logical order.

To fine-tune the pretrained base model dataset files in listed in manifest
files on all available GPUs:

::

        $ party --precision bf16-true train --load-from-hub mittagessen/llama_party --workers 32 -f train.lst -e val.lst

With the default parameters both baseline and bounding box prompts are randomly
sampled from the training data. It is suggested that you fine-tune the model
with uni-modal line embeddings by only selecting the line format that your
segmentation method produces, i.e.:

::

        $ party --precision bf16-true train --load-from-hub mittagessen/llama_party -f train.lst -e val.lst --prompt-mode curves

or:

::

        $ party --precision bf16-true train --load-from-hub mittagessen/llama_party -f train.lst -e val.lst --prompt-mode boxes


Inference
---------

To recognize text in pre-segmented page images in PageXML or ALTO with the
pretrained model run:

::

        $ party ocr -i input_file.xml output_file.xml

The paths to the image file(s) is automatically extracted from the XML input
file(s).

It is recommended to adjust the `--compile/--no-compile`,
`--quantize/--no-quantize`, and `--batch-size` arguments to optimize inference
speed for your inference environment.
